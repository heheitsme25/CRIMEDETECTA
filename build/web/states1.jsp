              <h2>Delhi</h2>
              <p>
                In Delhi, crimes such as theft, robbery, and snatching are prevalent, particularly in crowded areas and public transportation hubs. Instances of violent crimes, including murder, assault, and domestic violence, are reported, often stemming from personal disputes, gang-related activities, or economic disparities. Cases of crimes against women, including rape, harassment, and dowry-related violence, remain a significant concern. The city also grapples with issues of drug trafficking, organized crime, and cybercrime. Law enforcement agencies are actively working to address these challenges through increased patrolling, community engagement, and specialized task forces. However, concerted efforts are needed to curb crime rates and ensure public safety in Delhi.

              <p>
                Instances of violent crimes, including murder, assault, and communal tensions, are reported, often linked to personal disputes, political rivalries, or caste conflicts.
