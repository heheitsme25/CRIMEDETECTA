        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Our planet is facing a crisis - a crisis that often goes unnoticed and unaddressed. While we are all familiar with the pressing issues of climate change, pollution, and habitat destruction, there is another threat lurking beneath the surface: environmental crime. From illegal wildlife trafficking to deforestation, illegal fishing, and hazardous waste dumping, environmental crime poses a significant risk to our ecosystems, biodiversity, and the well-being of communities worldwide. In this blog post, we will delve into the world of environmental crime, exploring its various forms, causes, impacts, and the urgent need for collective action to combat this silent threat.
        </p>
        <h2>Understanding Environmental Crime</h2>
        <p>
            Environmental crime encompasses a wide range of illegal activities that harm the environment and exploit natural resources for profit. These crimes can take many forms, including:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Illegal Wildlife Trafficking:</b> The illegal trade in endangered species, their parts, and products.</li>
                <li><b>Illegal Logging and Deforestation:</b> The unauthorized cutting down of trees and destruction of forests for timber, agriculture, and other purposes.</li>
                <li><b>Illegal Fishing:</b> The unsustainable harvesting of marine resources through unauthorized fishing practices.</li>
                <li><b>Hazardous Waste Dumping:</b> The illegal disposal of toxic waste and electronic waste, often in developing countries with lax regulations.</li>
            </ul>
            
        </p>
        <h2>Causes and Impacts</h2>
        <p>
            Environmental crime is driven by a complex interplay of factors, including:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Profit Motive:</b> The lucrative nature of illegal wildlife products, timber, and fish drives criminal syndicates to exploit natural resources for financial gain.</li>
                <li><b>Weak Enforcement:</b> Inadequate laws, corruption, and lack of resources hamper efforts to prevent and prosecute environmental crimes effectively.</li>
                <li><b>Demand and Consumption:</b> High demand for wildlife products, timber, and seafood fuels illegal activities, perpetuating the cycle of exploitation.</li>
            </ul>
            The impacts of environmental crime are far-reaching and devastating:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Loss of Biodiversity:</b> Illegal wildlife trade and habitat destruction threaten the survival of endangered species and disrupt ecosystems.</li>
                <li><b>Deforestation and Climate Change:</b> Illegal logging contributes to deforestation, leading to habitat loss, carbon emissions, and climate change.</li>
                <li><b>Decline in Fish Stocks:</b> Overfishing and illegal fishing practices deplete marine resources, jeopardizing food security and livelihoods.</li>
                <li><b>Health Risks:</b> Hazardous waste dumping contaminates soil, water, and air, posing serious health risks to communities living near disposal sites.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Global Efforts to Combat Environmental Crime:</h2>
        <p>
            Despite the challenges, there are concerted efforts at the international, national, and local levels to combat environmental crime:
            <ul>
                <li><b>International Conventions:</b> Treaties such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and the Basel Convention aim to regulate and prevent environmental crime.</li>
                <li><b>Law Enforcement:</b> Governments, law enforcement agencies, and INTERPOL collaborate to investigate and prosecute environmental criminals.</li>
                <li><b>NGO Initiatives: </b> Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and conservation groups work to raise awareness, support enforcement efforts, and empower local communities to combat environmental crime.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            Environmental crimes in India are registered under a few special and local laws (SLLs). Until 2013, there was no publicly available data on environmental crime. In 2014, a chapter on environment-related offences was added to the ‘Crime in India’ statistics. The chapter contains data on the incidence of state and union territory (UT) wise environmental offences and gender-wise persons arrested for such offences. Further, data includes information on police disposal, such as cases investigated, cases pending for investigation, charge sheeting rate, case pendency percentage, etc. and court disposal such as the number of cases that went for trial, cases pending for trial, cases convicted, conviction rate, pendency percentage, etc. A look through the environmental  crime statistics for 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 will help the reader understand the analysis better.  For instance, in Tamil Nadu, the total number of registered environmental offences for the past eight years is as follows, 2014 (33 offences), 2015 (20 offences), 2016 (1), 2017 (20,914), 2018 (14,536), 2019 (13,316), 2020 (42,756) and 2021 (46,458). The blog will answer why there was a sudden surge of environmental offences in Tamil Nadu from 2017 onwards.

            <h3>A few observed limitations of environmental crime data</h3>
            The NCRB uses the following SLLs to determine the extent of environmental crime registration by police in India.
            <div style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="css/env.jpg"  width="50%" height="auto">
            </div>
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Limitation 1</h3>
            From 2017, the cases registered under the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and Forest Conservation Act, 1980 likewise Air Act, 1981 and Water Act, 1974 were combined while reporting the statistics (e.g., refer to page two of 2017 data). This has continued up to the latest ‘Crime in India’ statistics (i.e., 2021). Therefore, no inferences can be drawn from the actual number of cases registered under each SLL mentioned above.
            <h3>Limitation 2</h3> 
            The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, 2003 primarily regulates the advertisement, trade, commerce, production, supply and distribution of cigarettes and other tobacco products. While it is undeniable that the tobacco industry has a considerable impact on the environment, the Act does not have provisions to control environmental damage and does not fall under the purview of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) or the Pollution Control Boards/Committees (hereafter PCBs). It focuses  more on public health and criminalising of individual smokers and sellers. Therefore, violations under this Act may not be construed as environmental crimes. In 2021, there were 54,024 cases registered under the said Act. The high number of cases registered under this Act might just be against individuals who smoke in public places or sell such products near educational/health care institutions rather than violations by tobacco product manufacturers. For example, in 2021, cases registered in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Rajasthan alone constitute 94% of the total cases registered for the whole of India. This forms a statistical outlier when compared with other SLLs, and significantly affects and dilutes the inferences that can be drawn out of environmental crime data. Given this trend, Tamil Nadu stands first in the number of booked environmental crimes with a total of 1,38,031 cases, followed by Rajasthan (56,000 cases) and Kerala (22,109 cases) while cumulating eight years of data. This suggests a wrong inference of the environmental crime situation and blindly sticking to ‘just numbers’ will lead to misrepresentation and miscommunication of environmental crime data.
            <h3>Limitation 3</h3>
            The Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 includes various rules to handle and regulate plastic waste, solid waste, biomedical waste, etc., including the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000. In addition to this, certain states, like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Goa, have a ‘State Act’ to control noise pollution. Therefore, those states will register noise pollution-related cases under their own ‘State Act.’ The remaining states with no ‘State Act’ to deal with noise pollution should register cases under the Environment (Protection) Act of 1986. It is evident here that there is no uniform law to enlist cases relating to noise pollution. Therefore, presenting data under the head ‘Noise Pollution Act (State/Central)’ seems unnecessary (see page two of 2021 data).
            <h3>Limitation 4</h3>
            It is clear from Section 14 (1) of the National Green Tribunal Act of 2010 that the Tribunal shall have jurisdiction over all civil cases involving a substantial question relating to the environment. The only offence prescribed in the Act is failure to comply with the orders of the Tribunal. Such offences are deemed non-cognisable under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. Thus, if a company or a government department fails to comply with the orders of the NGT, they are liable under the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010. However, this may not amount to the commission of an environmental offence. Therefore, the NCRB data showing cases registered under the said Act is misleading, as commission of an offence and not complying with the orders of NGT are altogether different.  
            <h3>Limitation 5</h3>
            The inferences drawn from the environmental crime data are also limited based on the combination of different heads while presenting the data, as in Table 2. 
            <div style="text-align: center;">

            </div>
            From 2017 onwards, significant environmental law enforcement-related data points, such as the number of persons charge-sheeted by police; convicted, acquitted and discharged by courts, were added. However we cannot infer gender-wise persons arrested, charge-sheeted, convicted, acquitted and discharged under specific SLL in each state/UT. Also, the section on the disposal of registered cases by police and court is the heart and soul of environmental crime data. Unfortunately, the statistics only present either SLL-wise police and court disposal of cases collectively for India or state-wise disposal of cases collectively for SLLs. With this, the cases of charge-sheeted & pending investigation, convicted & pending trial under each SLL in each state/UT is unknown.
